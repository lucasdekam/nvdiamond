# Characterizing a permanent magnet using NV center electron spin
This is the code and data for a TU Delft research practicum. The contents are as follows:
* Raw data in the rawdata folder
* (Manually) processed data in the .txt files
* Code files that generate the plots in the report from the processed data files: b_direction_esrfit.py, b_magnitude_angle.py, b_magnitude_distance.py
* Code files that generate plots for the theory section: assignments.py and plotfieldlines.py
